# Register, Login and Keys

## Create an Account

To create an account on the SHARESAFE platform, just navigate to the `Register Page` and fill in the required information.

After creating an account, it will be downloaded a file with the user's private key.

**Note:** The private key file is very important and should be kept in a safe place.

### Public and Private Keys

The `public_key` field is used to store the user's public key, which is used to encrypt the files sent to the user.

The `private_key` field is used to store the user's private key, which is used to decrypt the files sent to the user.

## Login

To login, just navigate to the `Login Page` and fill in the required information.

If the login is successful, the user will be redirected to the `Home Page`, and a `token` will be generated and stored in the browser's `cookies`.
This `token` will be used to authenticate the user in the platform, and give access to the different functionalities.
