# Share to a Group of Users

Sharing files could be done not only to all users but to a specific set of users, in wich we call "Groups". Every user can create a group and specify wich users will belong to that group.

## How to create a Group

In order to create a group, the user must:

1. Go to inbox page;
2. Click the "New Group" button;
3. Enter the group name;
4. Enter the user's email wished to be added to the group and click "Add Member" (do this for every user);
5. Click "Create Group".
